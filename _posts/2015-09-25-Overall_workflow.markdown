#The Two Part Problem
Our project is a continuation on a previous project as well as an expansion. As such there are two main goals we are trying to achieve.
The first goal is to formulate a structure property relations using existing data. This will require a PCA on eisting data, than an expansion of PCA on more data
to correlate several aspects of the microstructure to the property. The second goal is to acheive a microstructure reconstruction. Each goal has different challenges and our 
overall workflow is shown in the diagram below.

#Discussion 
The biggest hurdlesin our problem will be the phase recovery problem for microstructure reconstruction. The PCA involved in formulating a structure property linkage may also
pose an issue. Since this project is on going more data pertaining to the WAXS, and SAXS images may become available including bivariate distributions. This could allow far more parameters to 
correlate the tear and dart data to polymer microstructure. A post will follow presenting the available data and the work we are building off of.
