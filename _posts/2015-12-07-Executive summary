## Project Definition

### Polymers and XRD

### Dataset 

We had to work with 3 types of dataset: 
1. First the SAXS (960 x 960 pixels) and WAXS (960 x 1920 pixels) images from 12 different polymers films.

 ![WAXS]({{ site.url}}/MIC-polymers/img/posts/WAXS_1_0000.png)
2. Second, a 18 x 19 excel table that contains  the process parameters, 3 mechanical properties and the morphological features of 18 polymers extracted from the SAXS and WAXS images. See [data extraction from the SAXS and WAXS images](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-polymers/2015/11/25/data-extraction-from-the-SAXS-and-WAXS-images/).
3. The  [bi-variate distributions](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-polymers/2015/10/30/PCAproblem-workflow-update/) of our polymers samples (4836x4 matrix). These distributions just represent the molecular composition of the polymers at an atomic level. 

We decide to tackle 2 different problems from our initial dataset
1. Generate a PSP linkage for the polymers films using the 18x19 excel table
2. Recover the polymers microstructure from the SAXS images.

### Challenges 

## Reconstruction Trial 

## PSP linkage results discussion 

The approach we will be taking is the described in the following image:
![Global approach]({{ site.url}}/MIC-polymers/img/posts/PCAproblem/final posts/problem definition.png)

This post gives more details about our workflow and the tools we used [PSP linkage global approach](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-polymers/2015/11/30/PSP_linkage_global_approach/)

The main criteria we will be using to compare the predictive models are [LOOCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) results (Leave one out cross validation) ,the RMPE (Root mean percentage error) and the absolute error percentage.


### Process-Structure Predictive model 

We start by reducing the each bi-variate distribution to one concatenated vector:
![Bivariate plots transformation]({{ site.url}}/MIC-polymers/img/posts/PCAproblem/results/bivariate.png)

We then put the 3 vector in PCA to extract the first component that yield 96% of the total variance (we will call it the bivariate PC). Then we are able to generate some predictive model of the bivariate PC as function of the structure parameters.

### Structure-Property Predictive model 

The goal is to predict the 3 mechanical properties using our 13 extracted features (see [data extraction from the SAXS and WAXS images](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-polymers/2015/11/25/data-extraction-from-the-SAXS-and-WAXS-images/) ).

We first perform a PCA on the variables. The results show that the first 4 components yields 97% of the variance.

![absolute error]({{ site.url}}/MIC-polymers/img/posts/PCAproblem/results/error.png). 


### Process-Structure-Property Predictive model 

Then we want to explore 2 other type of model:
1. Process-Property: Predict the mechanical properties using the process parameters
![PP error]({{ site.url}}/MIC-polymers/img/posts/PCAproblem/results/PP_error.png)
2. Process-structure-Property: Predict the mechanical properties using both the structure PCs and the process parameters.
